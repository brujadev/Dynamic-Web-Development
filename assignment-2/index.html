                <p class="content">Right now, I am loving <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ihartericka/">@ihartericka</a> and Ebony’s Instagram series. They’ve managed to inform the public of the our very nuanced history and also create content that is relevant and relatable.
                    For example, they asked a bunch of black people to send them videos of them drinking water. Genius for obvious reasons. </p>
