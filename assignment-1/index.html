      <a href="index.html#mine">I had knots in my throat and chest from not being able to explain what I was experiencing. 
        The anxiety came first. I remember that. I’d worry about the safety of my son and have horrific visions of what would 
        happen at any moment.</a> I had many nights where my heart and mind were so gripped with fear I couldn‬'t sleep. 
        <a href="index.html#mine">This is the part they do not tell you about becoming a mother: the restlessness and worrying 
            is unbearable, crippling and all consuming.</a> There wasn’t an adjustment period but rather a courage within myself 
            I had to dig and unearth. It doesn’t matter how bad you wanted it, <a href="index.html#mine">(pregnancy, baby, 
            creating your own family, etc.),</a> you’re never prepared for the journey. What I want to emphasize is that 
            <a href="index.html#mine">having a child is a pretty magical time in someone's life.</a> No matter how the big 
            picture unfolds, <a href="index.html#mine">every child needs its angel and after having a baby</a> you will be 
            made to realize that no matter what, you have <a href="index.html#mine"> a loving family and your child is safe 
              with you. This, for me, is one of</a> the greatest blessing<a href="index.html#mine">s of motherhood, knowing 
                that I am making a child with someone who loves them.</a> It's important for me to know how important it is 
                to be listened to. <a href="index.html#mine">Seeking professional help felt like a long tunnel I did not want to walk alone through. It would’ve been great if someone walked through it with me.</a><br><p class="through-the-mud"><a href="through-the-mud.html" style="background-color:none;color:darkblue;text-decoration:line-through">but we
